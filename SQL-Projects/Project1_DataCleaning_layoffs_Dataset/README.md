# 🧹 Project 1: Data Cleaning – Layoffs Dataset  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **cleaning the layoffs dataset (2020–2023)** to make it suitable for analysis.  
The raw dataset contained duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats, and unnecessary columns.  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Removed Duplicates** – Ensured each row in the dataset was unique.  
2. **Standardized Data** – Fixed inconsistent text formatting (e.g., company/industry names).  
3. **Handled Missing & Null Values** – Replaced, imputed, or removed where appropriate.  
4. **Dropped Unnecessary Columns** – Kept only relevant features for analysis.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)  

## 📂 Files Included  
- `Project1_DataCleaning_Layoffs.sql` → SQL script containing all cleaning steps  

## ✅ Outcome  
The cleaned dataset is consistent, free of duplicates, and ready for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the next project.
